# Projects in alphabetical order

## Personal Projects

- cribbit: C TACT library
- Jackalope: imgui-based audio player.
- lgbt-colors: a collection of LGBT-related colors
- Snep: Blender launcher/updater
- Wytch: Activitypub platform[^wytch]

[^wytch]: Design only. Pending on library, and my ability to comprehend activitypub systems which I'm doing by tinkering on my Misskey fork.

### Stalled

- Fibonacci Heap (DragonLib, astrastl)[^fib]
- glTF-Legiayayana-EXT: Personal glTF Extensions[^gltf]
- Kobold: General Purpose Game Engine[^kobold]
- pridegen: Untitled Pride Emoji Generator Project
- shard: megabundle utility for archiving incremental files[^shard]
- TLSF Memory Arena (DragonLib, astrastl)[^tlsf]
- WEMSharp: Wwise WEM and BNK parser in dotnet[^wem]

[^fib]: Implementing this at all is hard
[^gltf]: Delayed until I actually write something that can use it
[^kobold]: General Puprose Game Engines are a multi-person, decade-long endeavour that I haven't even started yet
[^shard]: Feature complete, but needs testing and polishing.
[^tlsf]: Implementing this in C# is hard
[^wem]: Lost interest.

## Game-related projects

These usually are relating to asset conversion and mod capabilities.

This usually reflects what games I'm playing, so progress comes and goes as I get or lose interest.

- EVE-Blender: EVE-Blender interopability plugins for artists
- EVE-Foxcat: EVE Multiboxing Switcher[^foxcat]
- Rivet: Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart (Insomniac Engine)
- Rocket: Gaurdians (Dawn Engine)
- Tosca: Crucible (Lumberyard)[^crucible]
- Witch: FFXV/Forspoken (Luminous Engine)[^luminy]

[^crucible]: It's the only game that used the public version of Lumberyard completely, New World has replaced a lot of systems with private modules.
[^foxcat]: I realize EVE-O exists, but I wanted to make one that could work on Linux and macOS as well. 
[^luminy]: FFXV and Forspoken are the only games to use Luminous, while technically a fork of Crystal Tools, I don't expect to see Luminous' Ebony structures in Crystal Tools or the FFXIV fork. So Fang and Yshtola will be more purpose built for their respective forks.
