# Projects in no particular order

## Active Projects

- cribbit: C TACT library
- Jackalope: imgui-based audio player.
- lgbt-colors: a collection of LGBT-related colors
- Snep: Blender launcher/updater
- Wytch: Activitypub platform[^wytch]

[^wytch]: Design only. Pending on library, and my ability to comprehend activitypub systems which I'm doing by tinkering on my Misskey fork.

## Paused Projects

- Fibonacci Heap (DragonLib, astrastl)[^fib]
- glTF-Legiayayana-EXT: Personal glTF Extensions[^gltf]
- Kobold: General Purpose Game Engine[^kobold]

- TLSF Memory Arena (DragonLib, astrastl)[^tlsf]
- WEMSharp: Wwise WEM and BNK parser in dotnet[^wem]
- shard: megabundle utility for archiving incremental files[^shard]

[^tlsf]: Implementing this in C# is hard
[^fib]: Implementing this at all is hard
[^kobold]: General Puprose Game Engines are a multi-person, decade-long endeavour that I haven't even started yet
[^gltf]: Delayed until I actually write something that can use it
[^wem]: Lost interest.
[^shard]: Feature complete, but needs testing and polishing.
